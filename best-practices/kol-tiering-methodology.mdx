## Why Tiering Matters

Not all KOLs are equal. A global thought leader who chairs international conferences requires different engagement than an emerging researcher. Tiering helps you:

- **Allocate resources effectively**: Focus time and budget on highest-impact relationships
- **Customize engagement strategies**: Different tiers need different touchpoints
- **Measure portfolio health**: Ensure balanced coverage across influence levels
- **Align cross-functional teams**: Give everyone a common language for prioritization

## The 4-Tier Framework

| Tier | Definition | Typical Profile | Engagement Strategy |
|------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Global thought leaders | Top journal authors, international conference chairs, guideline committee members | 1:1 strategic partnership, personal relationship with senior leadership |
| **Tier 2** | Regional experts | National society board members, active researchers, frequent speakers | Advisory boards, speaker programs, investigator meetings |
| **Tier 3** | Local influencers | Hospital department heads, high-volume practitioners, regional opinion shapers | Educational events, peer-to-peer programs, local symposiums |
| **Tier 4** | Emerging voices | Early-career researchers, rising clinicians, digital-native physicians | Content engagement, early access programs, mentorship opportunities |

## Tiering Criteria

Use these factors to classify KOLs:

### 1. Scientific Influence

| Factor | How to Assess | Data Sources |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Publication record | H-index, citation count, journal impact factors | PubMed, Google Scholar |
| Guideline involvement | Authorship on clinical guidelines | Society websites, guideline documents |
| Grant funding | PI on major research grants | NIH Reporter, institutional profiles |
| Patent activity | Inventor on relevant patents | USPTO, patent databases |

### 2. Clinical Influence

| Factor | How to Assess | Data Sources |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Procedure volume | Number of relevant procedures performed | Hospital data, claims databases |
| Referral network | Physicians who refer patients to this KOL | Network analysis tools |
| Training role | Fellowship director, residency faculty | Institutional websites |
| Adoption behavior | Early vs. late adopter of new technologies | Field intelligence, sales data |

### 3. Professional Influence

| Factor | How to Assess | Data Sources |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Society leadership | Board positions, committee chairs | Society websites |
| Conference presence | Speaking roles, session chairs | Conference programs |
| Media presence | Quoted in press, social media following | News searches, social platforms |
| Peer recognition | Awards, named lectures | CV review, institutional announcements |

### 4. Engagement Potential

| Factor | How to Assess | Data Sources |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Past collaboration | History with your company | CRM records, Stratosphere activity log |
| Competitor relationships | Engagements with competitors | Field intelligence, disclosure databases |
| Availability | Willingness to participate | Direct outreach, response history |
| Alignment | Fit with your therapeutic focus | Research interests, clinical practice |

## How to Apply This in Stratosphere

### Step 1: Create Tiering Criteria for Your Context

Customize the framework for your therapeutic area:

**Example: Structural Heart Devices**
- Tier 1: Performing 100+ TAVR procedures/year, guideline author, international speaker
- Tier 2: Performing 50-100 procedures/year, national speaker, active researcher
- Tier 3: Performing 20-50 procedures/year, regional influence
- Tier 4: Early career, fewer than 20 procedures/year, digital presence

### Step 2: Assess and Classify KOLs

1. Go to **KOL** in Stratosphere
2. Open a KOL profile
3. Review available data:
   - Publications count and H-index (if available)
   - Specialties and expertise areas
   - Past event participation
   - Engagement history
4. Set the **Tier** field: Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3
5. Set the **Engagement Level**: High, Medium, or Low

<Tip>
Tier reflects *potential* influence. Engagement Level reflects *current* relationship status. A Tier 1 KOL might have Low engagement if you haven't worked with them yet.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Use Tiers for Planning

**Filter by Tier** in the KOL list to:
- Plan advisory board composition (mix of Tier 1-2)
- Identify Tier 3 KOLs for regional speaker programs
- Find Tier 4 KOLs for early career development initiatives

**Use AI Insights** to:
- Get product alignment recommendations per tier
- Identify event opportunities for specific KOLs
- Suggest engagement strategies

### Step 4: Review and Update Regularly

KOL status changes over time. Review tiering:
- **Annually**: Full portfolio review
- **Quarterly**: Spot-check top KOLs for changes
- **Event-driven**: Update after major publications, role changes, or collaborations

## Common Tiering Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's a Problem | How to Avoid |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Over-weighting publications** | Clinician KOLs may have fewer publications but high procedure volume | Balance scientific and clinical criteria |
| **Static tiering** | KOLs rise and decline in influence | Schedule regular reviews |
| **Ignoring engagement potential** | High-influence KOL who won't engage is less valuable | Include availability and alignment factors |
| **Too many Tier 1s** | Dilutes focus and resources | Limit Tier 1 to top 5-10% of your database |
| **Subjective classification** | Different team members classify differently | Document criteria, train team, calibrate regularly |

## Portfolio Health Metrics

Track these metrics across your KOL database:

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Tier distribution | 10% Tier 1, 25% Tier 2, 40% Tier 3, 25% Tier 4 | Ensure balanced portfolio |
| Engagement coverage | 80%+ of Tier 1-2 with recent activity | High-value KOLs should be engaged |
| Tier mobility | 5-10% tier changes per year | Shows portfolio is dynamic |
| Geographic coverage | Aligned with market priorities | Ensure regional representation |
