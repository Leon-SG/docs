## Why Prompts Matter

Stratosphere AI is powerful, but the quality of output depends on the quality of input. Better prompts lead to:

- More relevant, specific content
- Fewer rounds of editing
- Content that matches your tone and brand
- Actionable recommendations

## Prompt Engineering Principles

### 1. Be Specific, Not Vague

| Vague Prompt | Specific Prompt |
|-------------|-----------------|
| "Write an email to a KOL" | "Write a formal invitation email to a Tier 1 cardiologist for our Q2 advisory board on TAVR innovations in Boston" |
| "Create a report" | "Generate a competitive landscape analysis of robotic surgical systems in orthopedics, focusing on US market, past 2 years" |
| "Draft a follow-up" | "Draft a thank-you email to Dr. Smith who attended our structural heart advisory board yesterday, referencing his input on valve durability" |

### 2. Provide Context

Include relevant background information:

```
Context: We are a medical device company specializing in structural heart
devices. Our target KOLs are interventional cardiologists performing TAVR
and TEER procedures.

Task: Write an invitation email for our upcoming advisory board.
```

### 3. Specify the Output Format

Tell the AI what you want:

| Specification | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Length | "Keep it under 200 words" |
| Tone | "Professional but warm" |
| Structure | "Use bullet points for key benefits" |
| Audience | "Written for a busy clinician" |

### 4. Use Examples (Few-Shot)

Provide an example of what good output looks like:

```
Write an email similar to this style:

"Dear Dr. Johnson,

I hope this message finds you well. Your recent publication on bicuspid
aortic valve management caught our attention, and I wanted to reach out
regarding an opportunity to share your expertise..."

Now write a similar email for Dr. Chen, referencing her work on TEER outcomes.
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain of Thought

For complex tasks, ask the AI to think step by step:

```
I need to plan outreach to 50 KOLs for our product launch.

Please:
1. First, suggest how to segment these KOLs by tier and specialty
2. Then, recommend different messaging approaches for each segment
3. Finally, draft a sample email for each segment
```

### Iterative Refinement

Start broad, then narrow:

```
Round 1: "Draft an advisory board invitation for cardiologists"
Round 2: "Make it more concise, under 150 words"
Round 3: "Add a specific reference to the KOL's recent publication on TAVR"
```

### Role Assignment

Tell the AI what perspective to take:

```
You are a Medical Affairs director at a structural heart device company.
Write an email to a Tier 1 KOL inviting them to serve on your scientific
advisory board.
```

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Too vague | Generic output | Add specificity: who, what, when, why |
| No context | Misaligned content | Provide background on your company, product, audience |
| Too long | AI gets lost | Break into smaller requests |
| Unclear output format | Wrong structure | Specify format, length, sections |
| Expecting perfection | Frustration | Plan for editing and refinement |
