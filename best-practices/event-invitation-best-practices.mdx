## Why Invitation Strategy Matters

The difference between a 30% and 60% RSVP rate often comes down to execution, not the event itself. This guide covers proven tactics for medical device events.

## Timing: When to Send

### Initial Invitation Timeline

| Event Type | Send Initial Invite | Why |
|------------|--------------------|----|
| **Advisory Board** | 6-8 weeks before | KOLs have busy schedules, need advance notice |
| **Conference/Symposium** | 8-12 weeks before | Allow time for travel planning |
| **Training/Workshop** | 4-6 weeks before | Shorter commitment, less lead time needed |
| **Webinar** | 2-4 weeks before | Lower commitment, shorter planning cycle |

### Best Days and Times

| Factor | Recommendation | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Day of week** | Tuesday-Thursday | Monday = inbox overflow, Friday = weekend mode |
| **Time of day** | 9-10 AM local time | Caught during morning email review |
| **Avoid** | Monday mornings, Friday afternoons | Low engagement periods |

<Tip>
In Stratosphere, use the **Send Time** setting when scheduling campaigns. Choose "Morning (9 AM)" or "AI Optimal" for best results.
</Tip>

## Follow-up Cadence

### Recommended Sequence

| Touchpoint | Timing | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| **Initial invitation** | 6-8 weeks out | Announce event, request RSVP |
| **Reminder 1** | 4 weeks out | Gentle reminder for non-responders |
| **Reminder 2** | 2 weeks out | Urgency messaging, deadline approaching |
| **Final reminder** | 1 week out | Last chance, waitlist mention |
| **Confirmation** | 2-3 days out | Logistics for confirmed attendees |
| **Day-of reminder** | Morning of event | Final details, virtual link |

### How to Set Up in Stratosphere

1. Go to **Events** → Select your event
2. Click **Automation** tab
3. Enable automated reminders:
   - Pre-event reminders (1 week, 1 day)
   - Confirmation to registered attendees
4. Use **Invitations** tab to manually trigger additional touchpoints

## Subject Lines That Work

### Principles

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Lead with value proposition | Start with company name |
| Include event name and date | Use vague language |
| Create urgency when appropriate | Use ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation |
| Personalize when possible | Be generic |

### Templates by Event Type

**Advisory Board:**
- "Invitation: [Topic] Advisory Board – [City], [Date]"
- "[First Name], join our [Topic] Advisory Board"
- "Your expertise requested: [Topic] Advisory Board"

**Conference/Symposium:**
- "[Conference Name] – Save the Date: [Date]"
- "Speaking opportunity: [Conference Name] in [City]"
- "Join us at [Conference Name] – Early registration open"

**Reminder emails:**
- "Reminder: [Event Name] RSVP requested by [Date]"
- "[First Name], have you registered for [Event Name]?"
- "Only [X] spots remaining for [Event Name]"

### Personalization Variables in Stratosphere

Use these variables in your email templates:

| Variable | Output |
|----------|--------|
| `{{first_name}}` | Recipient's first name |
| `{{last_name}}` | Recipient's last name |
| `{{full_name}}` | Recipient's full name |
| `{{title}}` | Professional title |
| `{{company}}` | Institution/company name |
| `{{event_name}}` | Event title |
| `{{event_date}}` | Event date |
| `{{event_location}}` | Event venue |

## Email Content Best Practices

### Structure

1. **Opening** (1-2 sentences): Personal greeting, reason for reaching out
2. **Event overview** (2-3 sentences): What, when, where, why it matters
3. **Value proposition** (2-3 bullets): What they'll gain by attending
4. **Logistics** (brief): Date, location, virtual/in-person, time commitment
5. **Call to action** (1 sentence): Clear RSVP request with deadline
6. **Closing**: Thank you, contact for questions

### Length Guidelines

| Event Type | Ideal Length |
|------------|-------------|
| Advisory Board | 200-300 words |
| Conference | 150-250 words |
| Webinar | 100-150 words |
| Reminder | 50-100 words |

## Handling Non-Responders

### Escalation Strategy

| Stage | Action | Template |
|-------|--------|----------|
| After Reminder 1 | Phone call attempt | "Calling to ensure you received the invitation..." |
| After Reminder 2 | Personal email from senior leader | Executive-level outreach |
| After Final Reminder | Accept non-response | Move to future event consideration |

### Segment Non-Responders

In Stratosphere:
1. Go to **Events** → Select event
2. Filter attendees by status: **Pending**
3. Review for patterns:
   - Same institution? Try different contact.
   - Historical non-responder? Adjust expectations.
   - Wrong email? Verify contact info.

## Metrics to Track

### Invitation Funnel

| Metric | Calculation | Benchmark |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Delivery rate** | Delivered / Sent | >95% |
| **Open rate** | Opened / Delivered | 40-60% |
| **Response rate** | Responded / Opened | 30-50% |
| **Confirmation rate** | Confirmed / Responded | 70-80% |

### In Stratosphere

View these metrics on the **Events** dashboard:
- RSVP breakdown: Confirmed / Tentative / Declined / Pending
- Invitation funnel: Sent → Delivered → Opened → Responded

## A/B Testing Ideas

Test these elements to improve performance:

| Element | Test Variants |
|---------|---------------|
| Subject line | Value-focused vs. urgency-focused |
| Send time | Morning vs. afternoon |
| From name | Individual name vs. company name |
| CTA button | "RSVP Now" vs. "Confirm Attendance" |
| Email length | Detailed vs. concise |

<Info>
Start with subject line tests—they have the highest impact on open rates.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Sending too early | Forgotten by event date | Follow recommended timeline |
| Too many reminders | Annoyance, unsubscribes | Cap at 3-4 touchpoints |
| Generic subject lines | Low open rates | Personalize and add specificity |
| No clear CTA | Confused recipients | One clear action per email |
| Missing logistics | Follow-up questions | Include all essential details |
| Ignoring timezone | Wrong send time | Use recipient's local time |
