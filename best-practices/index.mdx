## Why Best Practices Matter

| Without Best Practices | With Best Practices |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Inconsistent KOL classification across team | Standardized tiering framework everyone uses |
| Low event invitation response rates | Optimized timing and messaging for higher RSVPs |
| Generic AI outputs | Specific, actionable AI-generated content |
| Ad-hoc processes | Repeatable, scalable workflows |

## How to Use These Guides

2. **Apply in Stratosphere**: Follow the specific steps to implement
3. **Adapt to your context**: Customize based on your therapeutic area, geography, and team structure
4. **Measure and iterate**: Track results and refine your approach

<Tip>
