## Overview

The Stratosphere API enables you to programmatically access and manage your medical device commercial operations data. Use it to:

- **Sync KOL data** with your CRM or internal systems
- **Automate event workflows** and attendee management
- **Trigger campaigns** based on external events
- **Monitor regulatory signals** and integrate with compliance tools
- **Export analytics** for business intelligence

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.getstrato.dev/v1
```

## Authentication

The Stratosphere API uses API keys for authentication. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.getstrato.dev/v1/kols" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure. Do not expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>
