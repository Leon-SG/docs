title: "Event Management: From Planning to Post-Event Follow-up"
description: "Learn how to plan, execute, and follow up on medical conferences and advisory boards using Stratosphere's event management platform."

## The Challenge

Running medical events involves coordination across multiple workstreams:

- **Attendee management**: Tracking RSVPs across dozens of KOLs
- **Invitation chaos**: Lost emails, manual follow-ups, no visibility into open rates
- **Agenda coordination**: Constant changes, speaker confirmations, timing conflicts
- **Materials preparation**: Last-minute requests for attendee lists, agendas, speaker bios
- **Post-event gaps**: No systematic follow-up or thank you communications

## How Stratosphere Helps

Stratosphere manages the complete event lifecycle in one platform:

```
Planning → Invitations → Execution → Follow-up
```
