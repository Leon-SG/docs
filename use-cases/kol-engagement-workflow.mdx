## The Challenge

Medical device companies face common KOL management challenges:

- **Scattered data**: KOL information lives in spreadsheets, CRMs, and email threads
- **No engagement history**: Hard to track who contacted whom and when
- **Manual tiering**: Subjective classification without data-driven criteria
- **Event coordination**: Difficulty matching the right KOLs to the right events
- **Compliance gaps**: Inconsistent documentation of interactions

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Build Your KOL Database

**Option A: Manual Entry**
1. Go to **KOL** from the main navigation
2. Click **New KOL**
3. Fill in profile fields:
   - Name, title, institution, department
   - Specialties and expertise areas
   - Contact information (email, phone, LinkedIn)
   - Tier classification and engagement level

**Option B: Bulk Import via CSV**
1. Download the CSV template from [Import KOLs](/guides/kol/import-kols-csv)
2. Fill in required fields: `full_name`, `specialties`
3. Add optional fields: email, institution, tier, engagement level
4. Upload and validate—import up to 100 KOLs at once

<Tip>
Start with your top 50 KOLs. You can always add more later.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Tier Your KOLs

Use a consistent framework to classify KOLs:

| Tier | Definition | Typical Engagement |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Global thought leaders, top journal authors, conference chairs | 1:1 strategic partnership, advisory boards |
| **Tier 2** | Regional experts, active researchers, society members | Advisory boards, speaker programs |
| **Tier 3** | Emerging voices, clinical practitioners | Educational events, peer-to-peer programs |

In Stratosphere:
1. Open a KOL profile
2. Set the **Tier** field (Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3)
3. Set **Engagement Level** (High, Medium, Low)

<Info>

### Step 3: Log Interactions

Every touchpoint matters. Use Quick Actions to log activities:

1. Open a KOL profile
2. Click **Quick Actions**
3. Choose the interaction type:
   - **Made Contact**: Phone calls or direct contact
   - **Sent Email**: Email communications
   - **Meeting**: Scheduled or completed meetings
   - **Follow-up**: Mark for future action
4. Add optional notes and date

All interactions appear in the KOL's activity timeline.

### Step 4: Leverage AI Insights

Stratosphere AI analyzes each KOL profile to provide:

- **Product Alignment**: Which products match this KOL's expertise? (High/Medium/Low relevance)
- **Event Recommendations**: Which upcoming events should this KOL attend?
- **Campaign Suggestions**: What outreach would resonate?

To view AI Insights:
1. Open a KOL profile
2. Click the **AI Insights** tab
3. Review recommendations and take action

### Step 5: Engage Through Events and Campaigns

**Add KOLs to Events**
1. Go to **Events** → select an event
2. Click **Attendees** tab → **Add Attendee**
3. Search and select KOLs from your database
4. Assign roles (speaker, panelist, attendee)

**Add KOLs to Campaigns**
1. Go to **Campaigns** → select a campaign
2. Click **Audience** → **Add Recipients**
3. Select KOLs or filter by tier/specialty

### Step 6: Monitor and Iterate

Track engagement metrics across your KOL portfolio:

- **Response rates**: How many KOLs respond to invitations?
- **Event participation**: Who attends repeatedly?
- **Engagement trends**: Is engagement level increasing or decreasing?

Use filters in the KOL list to segment by:
- Tier
- Engagement level
- Event history
- Invitation status
