## The Challenge

Medical device regulatory teams face an overwhelming information landscape:

- **Information overload**: Hundreds of regulatory updates daily across FDA, EMA, NMPA, Health Canada, TGA
- **Relevance filtering**: Which updates actually affect your products?
- **Delayed awareness**: Learning about critical changes too late
- **Impact assessment**: Understanding what actions are required
- **Cross-functional coordination**: Notifying the right teams at the right time

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Configure Your Signal Sources

Stratosphere monitors regulatory authorities automatically:

| Source | Coverage | Update Frequency |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **FDA** | US medical device regulations, 510(k), PMA, recalls | Daily |
| **EMA** | EU medical device regulations, MDR updates | Daily |
| **NMPA** | China medical device regulations | Daily |
| **Health Canada** | Canadian medical device licensing | Daily |
| **TGA** | Australian therapeutic goods | Daily |
| **Industry News** | Medical device industry publications | Continuous |

Signals are fetched automatically in the background.

### Step 2: Review the Signal Dashboard

1. Go to **Signals** from the main navigation
2. View signals in two modes:
   - **Map View**: Geographic visualization of signal sources worldwide
   - **List View**: Sortable, filterable table of all signals

Each signal card shows:
- **Title**: Headline of the regulatory update
- **Source**: Which authority or publication
- **Date**: When it was published
- **Impact Level**: Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- **Sentiment**: Positive, Neutral, or Negative

### Step 3: Filter for Relevance

Use filters to focus on what matters:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | FDA, EMA, NMPA, Health Canada, TGA, Industry |
| **Impact Level** | Critical, High, Medium, Low |
| **Sentiment** | Positive, Neutral, Negative |
| **Product** | Your registered products |
| **Time Range** | Today, Week, Month, Quarter, All |

<Tip>
Start your day by filtering for **Critical** and **High** impact signals from the past 24 hours.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Analyze Signal Details

Click any signal to open the detail panel:

#### AI-Generated Summary
A concise 2-3 sentence summary of the regulatory update, written in plain language.

#### Key Points
Bullet-point extraction of the most important information:
- What changed?
- Who is affected?
- What are the deadlines?

#### Impact Assessment

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Impact Level** | Critical / High / Medium / Low |
| **Impact Score** | 0-100 numeric score |
| **Impact Category** | Regulatory, Compliance, Safety, Market, Technology |
| **Impact Description** | Detailed explanation of business implications |

#### Next Steps
AI-generated actionable recommendations:
- "Review product labeling for compliance with new requirements"
- "Schedule internal review meeting within 2 weeks"
- "Update quality management system documentation"

### Step 5: Assess Product Impact

Stratosphere automatically correlates signals with your registered products:

1. Open a signal detail
2. View the **Product Relevance** section
3. See affected products with:
   - **Relevance Type**: Direct, Indirect, or Potential
   - **Confidence Score**: 0-100% certainty
   - **Relevance Explanation**: Why this product is affected

You can confirm or dismiss product correlations to improve future accuracy.

#### Setting Up Products

For best results, register your products in Stratosphere:

1. Go to **Products** from the main navigation
2. Click **New Product**
3. Enter product details:
   - Name and description
   - Regulatory classification
   - Target markets (US, EU, China, etc.)
   - Key therapeutic areas

The AI uses this information to match signals to products.

### Step 6: Take Action

#### Bookmark Important Signals
- Click the bookmark icon to save signals for later review
- Access bookmarked signals from the filter menu

#### Create an Investigation
For complex regulatory changes, promote a signal to a full investigation:

1. Open the signal detail
2. Click **Create Investigation**
3. Stratosphere generates a research framework based on the signal
4. Generate a comprehensive report with AI analysis

#### Share with Your Team
- Mark signals for team review
- Add notes with your analysis
- Export signal reports for meetings

### Step 7: Monitor Continuously

Stratosphere provides real-time monitoring:

- **Live Indicator**: Shows when background signal fetching is active
- **Unread Signals**: Badge showing new signals since your last visit
- **Archive**: Move resolved signals out of your active view

Set up a daily review routine:
1. Check Critical/High signals each morning
2. Review product-correlated signals weekly
3. Archive processed signals to keep your dashboard clean

## Signal Categories and Response

| Impact Level | Typical Content | Recommended Response |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Critical** | Recalls, safety alerts, immediate compliance requirements | Same-day review, escalate to leadership |
| **High** | New regulations, significant guidance changes | Within 48 hours, cross-functional review |
| **Medium** | Draft guidance, industry trends, competitor actions | Weekly review, track for developments |
| **Low** | Minor updates, general news, informational content | Monthly review, archive as needed |

## Real Results

Regulatory teams using Stratosphere typically see:

- 60% reduction in time spent scanning regulatory sources
- Earlier awareness of critical changes (hours vs. days)
- Better product-signal correlation accuracy over time
