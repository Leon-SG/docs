## The Challenge

Medical device teams need intelligence reports but face constraints:

- **Time-consuming research**: Hours spent gathering and synthesizing information
- **Inconsistent quality**: Reports vary based on who creates them
- **Outdated information**: By the time reports are finished, data is stale
- **Limited depth**: Surface-level analysis due to time pressure
- **No standardization**: Every report has a different structure

## How MedStrato Helps

MedStrato's Investigations module uses AI to generate comprehensive research reports:

## Investigation Templates

MedStrato provides five core templates:

| Template | Purpose | Typical Use Case |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| **Market Analysis** | Market size, growth trends, competitive landscape | Strategic planning, board presentations |
| **Regulatory Intelligence** | Latest regulatory changes, compliance requirements | Regulatory affairs updates |
| **Competitive Landscape** | Key players, positioning, strategies, SWOT | Business development, product planning |
| **Technology Assessment** | Emerging tech trends, R&D developments, patents | Innovation strategy, R&D prioritization |
| **Clinical Evidence** | Trial data, evidence synthesis, real-world data | Medical affairs, publications planning |

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Start a New Investigation

1. Go to **Investigations** from the main navigation
2. Click **New Investigation**
3. Choose a template that matches your research goal

### Step 2: Define Your Research Question

Enter a clear, specific research question or topic:

**Good examples:**
- "Analyze the US structural heart device market focusing on TAVR and TEER technologies"
- "Compare regulatory pathways for AI-enabled diagnostic devices in US, EU, and China"
- "Assess the competitive landscape for robotic surgical systems in orthopedics"

**Avoid vague topics:**
- "Medical devices" (too broad)
- "Market trends" (no specific focus)

<Tip>
The more specific your question, the more relevant the generated report.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Configure Research Parameters

Customize the scope of your investigation:

#### Time Period
| Option | Coverage |
|--------|----------|
| Recent (6 months) | Latest developments only |
| Current Year | Year-to-date analysis |
| Past Year | 12-month retrospective |
| Past 2 Years | Medium-term trends |
| Past 5 Years | Long-term market evolution |
| All Time | Historical comprehensive view |

#### Geographic Scope
| Option | Markets Covered |
|--------|-----------------|
| Global | Worldwide analysis |
| US | United States focus |
| EU | European Union focus |
| Asia-Pacific | APAC markets |
| China | China-specific analysis |
| Japan | Japan-specific analysis |
| Multi-region | Custom selection |

#### Data Sources
Select which sources to include:
- Regulatory databases (FDA, EMA, NMPA filings)
- Clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, registries)
- Scientific literature (PubMed, journals)
- Market research (industry reports)
- News and press releases
- Patents

#### Analysis Depth
| Option | Output Length | Best For |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Executive Summary | 2-3 pages | Quick briefings, email summaries |
| Standard | 5-10 pages | Team meetings, regular updates |
| Comprehensive | 15+ pages | Board presentations, strategic planning |

### Step 4: Generate the Report

1. Review your parameters
2. Click **Generate Investigation**
3. Watch real-time streaming as the AI writes the report
4. Generation typically takes 1-3 minutes depending on depth

You'll see a progress indicator showing completion percentage.

### Step 5: Review the Output

The generated report includes:

#### Structured Sections
- **Executive Summary**: Key findings at a glance
- **Market Overview**: Size, growth, segmentation
- **Key Players**: Major companies and their positions
- **Trends and Drivers**: What's shaping the market
- **Challenges and Risks**: Barriers and concerns
- **Outlook and Recommendations**: Forward-looking insights

#### AI-Generated Insights
- **Key Takeaways**: Bullet-point summary of critical findings
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific next steps for your team

### Step 6: Refine and Edit

The generated content is a starting point. You can:

1. Edit directly in MedStrato's markdown editor
2. Add your own analysis or commentary
3. Insert additional data or charts
4. Remove sections that aren't relevant

### Step 7: Export and Share

#### Download Options
- **PDF**: Professional formatted document for distribution
- **Word (DOCX)**: Editable format for further customization

#### Sharing
- Generate a shareable link with access control
- Set expiration dates for sensitive content
- Track who has viewed the document

## Advanced Features

### Promote Signals to Investigations

When you find an important regulatory signal, you can turn it into a full investigation:

1. Open a signal in the Signals module
2. Click **Create Investigation**
3. MedStrato extracts the research framework from the signal
4. Generate a comprehensive report on that topic

This is powerful for deep-diving into critical regulatory changes.

### Custom Variables

For recurring reports, use custom variables to personalize:
- Company name
- Product names
- Specific competitors
- Target markets

### Investigation History

All generated investigations are saved:
- View past reports anytime
- Track generation dates
- See export and share history

## Best Practices

### Do
- Start with a specific, focused research question
- Choose the appropriate analysis depth for your audience
- Review and edit AI-generated content before distributing
- Use regulatory and clinical sources for compliance topics

### Don't
- Expect perfect accuracy—always verify critical claims
- Use overly broad topics that lead to generic output
- Skip the review step before sharing externally
- Rely solely on AI for regulatory compliance decisions

<Warning>
AI-generated content should be reviewed by subject matter experts before external distribution or compliance decisions.
</Warning>

## Real Results

Teams using MedStrato Investigations typically see:

- 80% reduction in research report preparation time
- More consistent report quality across team members
