## What you can do

- Start AI-assisted workflows from a single prompt.
- Use slash commands to trigger common actions faster.
- Run standardized templates for recurring tasks (KOL discovery, event outreach, campaign drafts).

## How it works

### Prompt input

Use the main input bar to ask questions or give instructions in plain language (e.g., “Draft an event invite email for cardiologists in Singapore”).

### Slash commands

Type `/` to open a menu of quick actions and template shortcuts.

## Templates

Stratosphere AI includes pre-built templates for common workflows:

- **KOL discovery**: Identify and shortlist relevant experts for outreach.
- **Event autopilot**: Draft invitations and follow-ups for an event.
- **Product outreach**: Generate product introduction and seeding drafts.
- **Multi-touch campaign**: Build a multi-email engagement sequence.

## Notes

- **Roadmap**: future versions may support custom workflows you can save and reuse.
- **Accuracy**: verify AI-generated content before sending external communications.
