**1. Overview**

Stratosphere AI is an intelligent interface designed to accelerate marketing and event management workflows. It acts as a central command hub, allowing users to execute complex tasks through natural language processing and automated templates.

**2. Core Functionalities**

- **Interactive Input Field**

  Users can interact directly with the AI through the central search bar. The system supports two modes of input:
  - **Natural Language Queries**: Type questions or instructions in plain text ("Ask anything").
  - **Command Mode**: Type the forward slash / key to open a menu of specific system commands and quick actions.
- **System Templates**

  To standardize and speed up routine operations, Stratosphere AI provides pre-configured templates for key business activities:
  - **KOL Discovery**: Identify new Key Opinion Leaders from research databases based on specific criteria.
  - **Event Autopilot**: Automate the process of sending event invitations and follow-up reminders.
  - **Product Outreach**: Generate targeted email drafts for product seeding or introduction to KOLs.
  - **Multi-touch Campaign**: Create structured email sequences to manage ongoing engagement campaigns.

**3. Customization Roadmap**

While the current version operates on pre-defined system templates, future updates will introduce support for **Custom Workflows**. This enhancement will enable users to define, configure, and save their own automation sequences to meet specific operational requirements.

**4. Usage Disclaimer**

Please note that Stratosphere AI (v0.1.0) generates responses based on available data and models. Users are advised to verify all AI-generated information, particularly for external communications, to ensure accuracy and context.
