## What you can do

- Start from a proven template for faster drafting.
- Keep branding and structure consistent across campaigns.
- Use dynamic placeholders (variables) to personalize at scale.

## Common template types

The system offers specialized templates tailored to common industry engagement scenarios:

- **Event invitations and follow-ups**: pre-mapped placeholders (e.g., `{{event_name}}`) to pull event context.
- **Strategic Engagement**: The "KOL Engagement" template is designed for high-touch, personalized outreach regarding collaboration opportunities.
- **Product and Innovation Updates**: "New Feature Announcement" and "Product Update" templates allow for the structured presentation of new technical capabilities or medical device specifications to relevant experts.
- **Periodic Outreach**: The "Newsletter" template facilitates regular organizational updates to maintain long-term professional relationships.

## Drafting options

Users have full flexibility in how they construct their communications:

- **Start from Scratch**: Enables the creation of a completely custom email layout for unique requirements.
- **Template Utilization**: Users can select a pre-defined template as a foundation and modify it using the integrated drag-and-drop editor.
- **Dynamic Data Integration**: Templates utilize standardized variables to personalize content at scale, ensuring each recipient receives relevant information regarding specific events or products.

## Next step: set variables and preview

Once a template is selected, the system transitions to the "Create Email" interface, where users can refine the subject line, preview the layout across different devices, and finalize the HTML/CSS content before deployment. This ensures that all outgoing communications meet professional standards and strategic objectives.
