**1. Overview**

The Preview module provides a high-fidelity representation of outgoing communications before final deployment. This feature allows users to verify how dynamic variables and design elements render for individual recipients, ensuring that every email meets professional quality standards across different viewing environments.

**2. Individual Recipient Navigation**

To ensure personalization accuracy, the system allows for granular verification of the entire mailing list:

- **Sequential Preview**: Users can navigate through individual previews for every contact in the audience segment using the arrow controls (e.g., "2 of 8 recipients").
- **Variable Rendering Verification**: This mode displays the email exactly as the recipient will see it, with all auto-filled and custom variables (such as recipient names and specific event titles) fully integrated into the text.

**3. Multi-Device Display Optimization**

The preview interface supports cross-platform verification to ensure layout integrity:

- **Desktop View**: Displays the email as it will appear in standard web and desktop-based email clients.
- **Mobile View**: Toggles the display to a mobile-responsive format, allowing users to verify that text remains legible and buttons are correctly positioned for smartphone users.

**4. Final Review and Execution**

In the preview state, users can conduct a final audit of the **Subject Line**, **Sender Information**, and **Preheader Text**. If the content requires further adjustment, users can return to the "Design" or "Variables" tabs. Once the verification is complete for all recipients, the **Create Email** or **Send** button initiates the finalization of the communication workflow.
