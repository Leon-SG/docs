## What you can do

- Fill in all variables used by a template from one place.
- Separate “template-level” inputs (event name, sender title) from “recipient-level” inputs (first name).
- Avoid broken placeholders in previews and test sends.

## Where to find it

- In a campaign email editor, open the **Variables** panel.

## Variable types

Variables typically fall into two buckets:

- **Custom variables**: you fill these for the campaign/email (e.g., event name, calendar URL, discussion topic, sender name/title).
- **Auto-filled variables**: the platform fills these from recipient/system data (e.g., `{{first_name}}`, `{{unsubscribe_url}}`).

## Steps

1. Open **Variables** in the email editor.
2. Fill required custom variables.
3. Click **Done** to apply values back into the design.

## Troubleshooting

- If you still see `{{...}}` in preview, a required custom variable is missing.
- If personalization looks wrong for a recipient, check audience data (e.g., missing first name) and retry preview.
