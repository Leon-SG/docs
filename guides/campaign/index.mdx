## What you can do

- Create campaigns for launches, newsletters, and event outreach.
- Assign audiences and link related products for context.
- Draft, preview, and send emails from templates or scratch.
- Track delivery and engagement (opens, clicks).

## Where to find it

- Open `Campaigns` from the main navigation.

## Campaign structure

Most campaigns are organized into these tabs:

- **Overview**: dates, description, top-level metrics.
- **Audiences**: who receives the emails.
- **Products**: context for the outreach (what the campaign is about).
- **Emails**: drafts, schedules, and send history.

## Tip

Keep each campaign focused on a single goal (one event, one launch, or one theme). It improves deliverability and makes analytics easier to interpret.
