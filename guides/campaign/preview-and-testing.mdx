## What you can do

- Preview the email for a specific recipient (variables applied).
- Switch between desktop and mobile layout.
- Catch missing variables, broken links, and layout issues before sending.

## Steps

1. Open the email in your campaign and switch to **Preview**.
2. Use the arrows to step through recipients (e.g., “2 of 8”).
3. Toggle **Desktop** / **Mobile** views.
4. Verify the subject line, sender, preheader, and any key links/buttons.

## What to check

- **Variables render correctly**: no raw `{{variable}}` placeholders.
- **Layout and spacing**: headings, paragraphs, and buttons look good on mobile.
- **Links work**: event links, calendar links, unsubscribe link.
- **Branding**: logo, sender name/title, and tone are consistent.

## Next steps

- If anything is off, return to **Design** or **Variables**, then preview again.
- When ready, proceed to create/send the email per your campaign workflow.
