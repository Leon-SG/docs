![Billing and usage overview showing plan, usage, and limits](/images/image-19.png)

## What you can do

- Check your current plan and billing status.
- Review monthly usage (credits, investigations, articles).
- Monitor workspace limits (seats, KOLs, products, events, campaigns, registrations).

## Where to find it

- Open `Settings` → `Billing & Usage`.

## Subscription details

The header shows your active plan, billing frequency, and price per seat.

## Monthly usage

Use this section to track resources that reset each billing cycle (e.g., remaining days until reset).

Common metrics include:

- **AI credits**: general AI usage across the platform.
- **Investigations / deep research**: number of investigation runs.
- **Press articles**: number of generated drafts.

## Workspace limits

This section shows the total records and limits in your workspace (these do not reset monthly), such as:

- Seats (users)
- KOLs
- Products
- Events
- Campaigns
- Registrations

## Tip

If a progress bar is close to 100%, consider cleaning up unused records or upgrading your plan before hitting a hard limit.
