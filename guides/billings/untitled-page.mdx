### Subscription and Usage Management

**1. Overview** The Billing and Usage page provides centralized oversight of the organization’s subscription status, financial commitments, and resource consumption. This interface ensures transparency regarding service utilization and assists administrators in managing operational costs and scaling requirements.

**2. Subscription Details** The header section displays the current active plan (e.g., Business Plan) and the associated cost per seat.

- **Status Monitoring**: Users can verify if the subscription is active and view the billing frequency.
- **Manage Billing**: This utility provides direct access to the secure payment portal (Clerk Portal) for managing payment methods, updating billing information, and retrieving historical invoices.

**3. Monthly Usage Metrics** This section tracks the consumption of dynamic, AI-driven resources within the current billing cycle. Quotas in this category reset periodically, with the remaining time in the cycle clearly indicated (e.g., "Resets in 6 days").

- **AI Credits**: Monitors the utilization of general artificial intelligence processing power across the platform.
- **Investigations and Deep Research**: Tracks the number of autonomous AI research reports initiated within the month.
- **Press Articles**: Measures the volume of professional communications and press releases generated.

**4. Resource Usage and Database Limits** The Resource Usage panel provides real-time tracking of static data entities within the workspace. Unlike monthly metrics, these figures represent the total volume of records maintained in the system:

- **Administrative Seats**: The number of active user licenses currently in use versus the total allowance.
- **KOLs and Products**: Tracks the total population of the Key Opinion Leader and Product master databases.
- **Events and Campaigns**: Monitors the volume of active and historical collaboration records.
- **Registrations**: High-level count of the total regulatory filings managed within the system.

**5. Operational Oversight** Visual progress bars within each resource card allow administrators to identify when an organization is approaching its plan limits. This data-driven approach facilitates proactive seat management and provides the necessary insights for plan upgrades as the organization’s data footprint expands.
