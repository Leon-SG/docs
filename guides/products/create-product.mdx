## Steps

1. Open `Products` and click **Add Product**.
2. Fill in required fields (name, product line, description).
3. Set status and regulatory standing.
4. Add target markets and key features.
5. Click **Add Product** to save.

## Required fields

- **Product name**
- **Product line**
- **Technical description**

## Optional but recommended

- **Status** (e.g., in development, active)
- **Regulatory status** (by jurisdiction if available)
- **Target markets** (regions/countries)
- **Key features** (e.g., AI-powered, FDA cleared, CE marked)

## Product lines

Use product lines to keep a consistent taxonomy across your catalog (useful for analytics and filtering).

## Importing (optional)

If you have many products, use import tools to migrate legacy data in bulk (if available in your workspace).

## Tip

Keep descriptions short but specific. Good product descriptions improve SEO, search in the UI, and AI relevance in signals/investigations.
