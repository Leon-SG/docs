**1. Overview** The system provides a standardized workflow for registering new medical devices and managing existing product lines. To ensure the highest level of data utility for AI-driven cross-functional features, products can be entered manually with detailed metadata or migrated in bulk through automated import tools.

**2. Manual Product Entry** The "Add Product" interface captures the essential clinical and commercial parameters required for organizational tracking:

- **Basic Information**:
  - **Identification**: Users must define the **Product Name** and assign it to a specific **Product Line** to maintain architectural consistency within the portfolio.
  - **Technical Description**: A required field to document the primary function and clinical utility of the device.
  - **Lifecycle and Compliance**: Users can select the current development **Status** (e.g., In Development, Active) and the **Regulatory Status** to track global compliance milestones.
- **Market and Feature Tagging**:
  - **Target Markets**: Allows for the selection of geographic regions (e.g., United States, European Union, Japan) for commercial focus. Users can also add custom regional tags.
  - **Key Features**: Provides a standardized list of technical and regulatory tags—such as **AI-Powered**, **FDA Cleared**, **CE Marked**, and **HIPAA Compliant**—to facilitate precise filtering and LLM-driven opportunity scanning.

**3. Product Line Management** To support complex portfolios with multiple therapeutic areas, the system allows for the creation and editing of **Product Lines**.

- **Nomenclature Standardization**: By defining product lines (e.g., Ventilation Systems or Anesthesia Delivery), organizations can ensure that all devices are categorized correctly for high-level reporting and strategic analysis.
- **Administrative Access**: The "Add Product Line" function is accessible via the primary product dashboard menu, allowing administrators to expand the system’s organizational framework as the portfolio grows.

**4. Automated Data Import** For organizations with extensive legacy data or those performing large-scale portfolio migrations, the system supports an **Import** function.

- **Bulk Ingestion**: This utility allows for the simultaneous upload of multiple product entries, ensuring that the central repository is populated efficiently without manual data entry for every item.
- **Data Mapping**: During the import process, the system maps external data fields to the standardized product schema, ensuring that imported products remain fully compatible with AI-driven signals and investigation agents.

**5. Operational Workflow** Once a product is registered, it becomes a core data entity within the ecosystem. It will automatically trigger correlations with incoming regulatory signals, appear in KOL alignment analyses, and serve as a focal point for AI-generated market investigations. Users can finalize the entry by selecting **Add Product** or discard changes via the **Cancel** button.
