**1. Overview** The Products module serves as the authoritative central repository for an organization’s entire medical device portfolio. This module is designed to catalog detailed technical specifications, regulatory statuses, and commercial targets. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLM), the product database functions as a dynamic intelligence layer that integrates with other system modules—including KOL management, regulatory signals, and strategic investigations—to provide cross-functional insights.

**2. Product Cataloging and Categorization** To ensure structured data management, the interface provides comprehensive tools for organizing the product library:

- **Search and Retrieval**: Users can locate specific devices via the keyword search bar or sort the inventory by criteria such as "Recently Updated."
- **Category Filtering**: The system supports rapid segmentation through pre-defined product categories, including **Ventilation Systems**, **Anesthesia Delivery**, **Patient Monitoring**, **Infusion Systems**, and **Defibrillators**.
- **Product Addition**: The "Add Product" button enables the manual entry of new device data into the ecosystem.

**3. Detailed Inventory Tracking** The main registry provides high-level visibility into the operational and clinical parameters of each device:

- **Identification and Description**: Displays the product name, category, and a concise technical description (e.g., "High-end ICU ventilator with AI-driven weaning protocols").
- **Operational Status**: Tracks the current lifecycle state of the product (e.g., "Active").
- **Regulatory Status**: Monitors the global compliance standing for each device across various jurisdictions.
- **Target Markets**: Identifies the primary geographic regions for commercial distribution, such as North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.

**4. LLM-Driven Functional Integration** The Product module is not a static list; it utilizes LLM technology to facilitate seamless inter-module connectivity:

- **KOL Strategic Alignment**: The system automatically maps products to Key Opinion Leaders based on their clinical specialties and research focus, identifying high-alignment experts for specific device lines.
- **Regulatory Signal Correlation**: Incoming regulatory alerts from authorities like the FDA or EMA are automatically linked to relevant products in the inventory, enabling immediate impact assessment.
- **Investigation Context**: AI-driven investigations utilize the product database to provide tailored competitor analysis and opportunity scanning specific to the organization’s actual offerings.

**5. Administrative Utilities** Each product entry includes an **Actions** menu for granular management, allowing users to edit specifications, update regulatory milestones, or remove obsolete entries from the active registry. The pagination system ensures efficient navigation across extensive product portfolios.
