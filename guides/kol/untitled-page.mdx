**1. Overview**

The "Add New KOL" interface enables users to manually register Key Opinion Leaders within the organizational database. This comprehensive form ensures that all relevant expert data—ranging from professional credentials to strategic engagement levels—is captured and centralized.

**2. Profile and Basic Information**

- **Profile Photo**: Users can upload a professional headshot. Supported formats include JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP, with a maximum file size of 5MB.
- **Core Identity**: Capture the expert's **Full Name** (required), professional **Title**, and current **Institution**.
- **Logistical Data**: Define the specific **Department** and **Location** (City/State) to facilitate regional filtering and reporting.

**3. Contact and Social Information**

To ensure reliable outreach, the system provides fields for multiple communication channels:

- **Direct Contact**: Input professional **Email** addresses and **Phone** numbers.
- **Digital Presence**: Include **LinkedIn** and **Twitter (X)** profile URLs to monitor the expert's social influence and professional updates.

**4. Professional Expertise**

- **Specialties**: Users can define the KOL's clinical or academic focus. The system provides a "Suggestions" panel (e.g., Anesthesiology, Cardiology) for standardized tagging. Multiple specialties can be added to a single profile.
- **Expertise Areas**: Provides additional granular space to document specific research interests or clinical niche areas.

**5. Engagement and Strategic Settings**

This section defines how the organization interacts with the KOL:

- **Related Events**: Search for and link the KOL to existing events within the system. This establishes a historical record of participation.
- **Engagement & Tiering**: Assign an **Engagement Level** (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and a strategic **Tier** (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) to categorize the KOL’s importance to organizational objectives.
- **Internal Notes**: A dedicated space for confidential qualitative data, allowing team members to document specific preferences, past interactions, or relationship nuances.

**6. Finalizing the Entry**

- **Create KOL**: Once all mandatory and relevant fields are populated, select the "Create KOL" button to commit the data to the database.
- **Cancel**: Reverts all changes and returns the user to the primary KOL Management list without saving.
