## Find and segment KOLs

- **Search**: use the top bar to search by name, institution, or specialty.

Each KOL card typically shows:

- **Professional Identity**: Displays the KOL’s name, primary institution, and medical specialty (e.g., Anesthesiology, Cardiology).
- **Tiering and Classification**: Indicates the assigned strategic importance (e.g., Tier 2, Tier 3) and engagement level (e.g., Low, Medium).
- **Engagement History**: Shows the number of previous events the KOL has participated in and their current invitation status (e.g., "No invite").

## Common actions

- **Add New KOL**: The "New KOL" button initiates the process of creating a new expert profile within the database.
- **Detailed View**: Selecting a specific profile card from the list will populate the right-hand panel with comprehensive data, including full engagement history, research background, and related event details.
