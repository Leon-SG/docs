title: "Bulk Import KOLs via CSV"
---

**1. Overview**

The CSV Import tool is designed for the rapid, bulk population of the KOL database. This feature enables users to efficiently migrate existing expert registries or large datasets into the system while ensuring data consistency through standardized mapping.

**2. Template Preparation**

To ensure successful data ingestion and correct field mapping, users must adhere to the system's structural requirements.

- **Download Template**: Click the **Download Template** button to retrieve a CSV file containing the pre-configured column headers.
- **Data Formatting**:
  - **Required Fields**: Every entry must include a full_name and at least one specialties tag.
  - **Optional Fields**: Users may populate additional columns such as title, institution, email, linkedin_url, and engagement_level.
  - **Handling Multiple Values**: For fields that support multiple entries (e.g., specialties), wrap the values in double quotes and separate them with commas (Example: "Cardiology, Oncology").

**3. Upload Specifications**

- **File Format**: Only .csv files are supported.
- **File Size Limit**: The maximum allowable file size is 5MB.
- **Upload Methods**: Users can either drag and drop the file directly into the upload area or select **Browse Files** to locate the document on their local drive.

**4. Strategic Mapping**

The system supports the bulk assignment of strategic classifications during the import process:

- **Engagement Level**: Input "High", "Medium", or "Low" to set initial engagement states.
- **Tiering**: Input "Tier_1", "Tier_2", or "Tier_3" to categorize the strategic importance of the imported KOLs.

**5. Executing the Import**

Once the file is uploaded and validated, select the **Import** button to finalize the process. The system will process the records and add them to the primary KOL Management list. To exit the process without saving, select **Cancel**.
