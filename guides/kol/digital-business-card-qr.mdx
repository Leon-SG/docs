The QR code acts as a direct gateway to the KOL’s Public Profile Portal. When scanned via a mobile device, it provides immediate access to the expert's comprehensive data, including their H-index, research focus, and clinical expertise, without the need for manual searching.

## Export formats

To support various professional use cases, the system allows users to download the Digital Business Card in high-resolution formats:

- **PNG Format**: Optimized for digital use, such as inclusion in email signatures, presentation slides, or mobile sharing.
- **SVG Format**: A vector-based format ideal for professional printing, such as on physical business cards, conference badges, or promotional materials.

## Use cases

- **Conference Engagement**: During medical congresses or symposiums, experts can display their QR code to allow peers to quickly save their information and view their academic trajectory.
- **Inter-organizational Collaboration**: Facilitates rapid identification and connection between specialists across different institutions.
- **Professional Branding**: Allows KOLs to distribute their verified digital identity across multiple platforms, ensuring their latest achievements and research are always accessible to their professional network.
