**1. Overview**

The KOL Management module serves as a centralized repository for identifying, tracking, and managing Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs). This interface provides granular visibility into expert profiles, their professional affiliations, and their historical engagement metrics with the organization.

**2. Discovery and Navigation**

To facilitate rapid data retrieval, the interface includes several navigational tools:

- **Search Functionality**: Users can locate specific experts by searching for names, institutions, or medical specialties via the top search bar.
- **Alphabetical Indexing**: An A–Z navigation sidebar on the right allows users to jump directly to specific entries based on the KOL's surname.
- **Quick Filters**: Pre-defined tabs at the top enable high-level segmentation, allowing users to filter the list by Tier 1 (T1) status, engagement history (Has Events), or active outreach (Has Invites).

**3. KOL Profile Cards**

Each entry in the list provides a condensed summary of the expert’s profile to assist in quick assessment:

- **Professional Identity**: Displays the KOL’s name, primary institution, and medical specialty (e.g., Anesthesiology, Cardiology).
- **Tiering and Classification**: Indicates the assigned strategic importance (e.g., Tier 2, Tier 3) and engagement level (e.g., Low, Medium).
- **Engagement History**: Shows the number of previous events the KOL has participated in and their current invitation status (e.g., "No invite").

**4. Management Actions**

- **Add New KOL**: The "New KOL" button initiates the process of creating a new expert profile within the database.
- **Detailed View**: Selecting a specific profile card from the list will populate the right-hand panel with comprehensive data, including full engagement history, research background, and related event details.
