## What this page is

Each KOL can have a public-facing profile page you can share with internal or external stakeholders. It consolidates key bio, credentials, and academic indicators into a single URL.

## What’s included

- **Academic Credibility Metrics**: The profile prominently displays the expert’s **H-Index**, providing an immediate, data-driven assessment of their scientific impact and publication authority.
- **Professional Identity**: Includes the expert’s high-resolution headshot, full name, primary institution (e.g., Hennepin Healthcare), and geographical location.
- **Narrative Bio and Expertise**:
  - **About**: A concise professional summary detailing the expert's clinical focus and career objectives.
  - **Expertise Tags**: Standardized clinical tags (e.g., "Emergency Medicine") that allow for immediate identification of the expert's primary medical domain.

## Sharing and utility tools

The top utility bar provides several mechanisms for sharing and utilizing the profile data:

- **QR Code**: Generates a scannable code for instant mobile access to the profile, ideal for use during in-person conferences or presentations.
- **Copy Link**: Provides a unique, permanent URL (e.g., app.medstrato.com/people/[unique_id]) for digital distribution via email or internal reports.
- **Social Integration**: Supports direct sharing to **LinkedIn**, allowing the organization or the expert to highlight their professional standing within their broader network.
- **CV Download**: Enables one-click access to the expert's full Curriculum Vitae in a standardized format.

## Claiming a profile

A critical component of this portal is the **Claim** functionality. This allows the KOL to personally verify their profile, ensuring data accuracy and fostering a direct collaborative link between the expert and the organization. Once a profile is claimed, the expert can manage their own details, further increasing the value of the platform as a professional networking tool.

## Tip

Use public profiles when you need a consistent, shareable summary for introductions, conference prep, or internal briefs.
