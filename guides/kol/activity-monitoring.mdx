**1. Overview**

The **Activity** tab provides a real-time feed of a Key Opinion Leader’s professional and academic contributions. This module is designed to help users stay informed about an expert's latest research, publication trends, and social influence, enabling more informed and timely engagements.

**2. Academic Papers**

The system automatically aggregates and displays the KOL's most recent research contributions through integration with global academic databases.

- **Publication Details**: Lists the full title of the research paper, the complete list of authors, the journal or conference of publication, and the publication year.
- **Impact Metrics**: Displays real-time citation counts (e.g., via Semantic Scholar) to help users assess the academic influence of specific works.
- **Direct Access**: Each entry includes a **View Paper** link and the specific **DOI** (Digital Object Identifier), allowing users to access the full text or official publication page directly.
- **Contextual Abstracts**: Provides a concise summary of the research objectives and findings, allowing for rapid assessment of the KOL’s current scientific focus.

**3. Social Activity Integration**

To provide a holistic view of the KOL's professional footprint, the system is expanding its monitoring capabilities:

- **LinkedIn Feed**: Integration is currently in development. This upcoming feature will allow users to monitor the KOL’s social posts, professional updates, and public engagements directly within the profile view.

**4. Data Refresh**

The activity feed can be updated manually using the refresh icon in the top right corner of the panel, ensuring that the displayed research and social data reflect the most current information available.
