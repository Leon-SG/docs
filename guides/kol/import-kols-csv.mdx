## What you can do

- Import many KOLs at once from an existing spreadsheet or database.
- Standardize fields via a template to avoid mapping issues.
- Set tier and engagement level during import.

## Steps

1. Click **Download Template** and fill in your data.
2. Validate formatting (required fields, multi-value fields).
3. Upload the `.csv` and click **Import**.

## Template preparation

- **Required fields**: `full_name` and at least one `specialties` value.
- **Optional fields**: e.g. `title`, `institution`, `email`, `linkedin_url`, `engagement_level`.
- **Multiple values**: wrap in double quotes and separate with commas (e.g., `"Cardiology, Oncology"`).

## Upload requirements

- **File Format**: Only .csv files are supported.
- **File Size Limit**: The maximum allowable file size is 5MB.
- **Upload Methods**: Users can either drag and drop the file directly into the upload area or select **Browse Files** to locate the document on their local drive.

## Tier and engagement mapping

The system supports the bulk assignment of strategic classifications during the import process:

- **Engagement Level**: Input "High", "Medium", or "Low" to set initial engagement states.
- **Tiering**: Input "Tier_1", "Tier_2", or "Tier_3" to categorize the strategic importance of the imported KOLs.

## Import

Once the file is uploaded and validated, select the **Import** button to finalize the process. The system will process the records and add them to the primary KOL Management list. To exit the process without saving, select **Cancel**.
