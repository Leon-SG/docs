## Steps

1. Open `Press` and click **New Article**.
2. Fill in basics (title/topic) and the key points you must include.
3. Choose content settings (type, audience, language, tone).
4. Add SEO keywords and a target length if needed.
5. Optionally add quotes, then click **Generate Article**.

## Basics (title, topic, key points)

- **Article Title and Topic**: Users establish the primary headline and a detailed description of the article's core subject. This ensures the AI understands the specific context, such as a regulatory milestone, clinical trial success, or technological innovation.
- **Key Points**: This field allows for the input of specific, comma-separated details (e.g., "FDA approval," "clinical trial data") that must be emphasized within the narrative to ensure factual accuracy and strategic focus.

## Content settings

- **Content Type and Audience**: Select from various formats—such as **Blog Posts**, **Press Releases**, or **Professional Summaries**—and define the target demographic (e.g., **Healthcare Professionals**, **Investors**, or **Industry Analysts**).
- **Language and Tone**: Supports multi-lingual generation and specific writing tones (e.g., **Professional**, **Informative**, or **Technical**) to ensure the content resonates with the intended readership.
- **SEO and Length Optimization**: Users can define **SEO Focus Keywords** to maximize digital visibility and set a **Target Word Count** to meet specific publication requirements.

## Quotes (optional)

- **Stakeholder Attributions**: Users can manually add direct quotes from Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), clinical investigators, or company executives.
- **Authenticity**: Integrating these personalized statements allows the AI to weave expert opinions seamlessly into the narrative, providing the "human element" and professional validation required for high-impact industry communications.

## Brand alignment

- **Company Profile Integration**: By enabling the "Use Company Profile" option, the AI automatically incorporates verified company background information, product portfolio details, and the established corporate brand voice into every draft.
- **Generation**: Once all parameters and quotes are configured, the **Generate Article** function initiates the autonomous drafting process, producing a polished, ready-to-review professional document.

Tip: pick 1–3 SEO keywords that match how your audience searches (e.g., product category + region + compliance keyword), then reuse them consistently across related pages.
