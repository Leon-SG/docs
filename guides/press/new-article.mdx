**1. Overview** The Create Press Article interface provides a highly customizable framework for generating professional, industry-specific content. By defining the technical scope, target audience, and key messaging pillars, users can leverage the AI engine to produce structured drafts that align with organizational objectives and industry standards.

**2. Basic Information and Topic Definition**

- **Article Title and Topic**: Users establish the primary headline and a detailed description of the article's core subject. This ensures the AI understands the specific context, such as a regulatory milestone, clinical trial success, or technological innovation.
- **Key Points**: This field allows for the input of specific, comma-separated details (e.g., "FDA approval," "clinical trial data") that must be emphasized within the narrative to ensure factual accuracy and strategic focus.

**3. Strategic Content Settings** The system offers granular control over the stylistic and technical parameters of the article:

- **Content Type and Audience**: Select from various formats—such as **Blog Posts**, **Press Releases**, or **Professional Summaries**—and define the target demographic (e.g., **Healthcare Professionals**, **Investors**, or **Industry Analysts**).
- **Language and Tone**: Supports multi-lingual generation and specific writing tones (e.g., **Professional**, **Informative**, or **Technical**) to ensure the content resonates with the intended readership.
- **SEO and Length Optimization**: Users can define **SEO Focus Keywords** to maximize digital visibility and set a **Target Word Count** to meet specific publication requirements.

**4. Quotes and Statements Integration** To enhance the authority and credibility of the article, the system includes a dedicated module for **Quotes & Statements**:

- **Stakeholder Attributions**: Users can manually add direct quotes from Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), clinical investigators, or company executives.
- **Authenticity**: Integrating these personalized statements allows the AI to weave expert opinions seamlessly into the narrative, providing the "human element" and professional validation required for high-impact industry communications.

**5. Brand Alignment and Execution**

- **Company Profile Integration**: By enabling the "Use Company Profile" option, the AI automatically incorporates verified company background information, product portfolio details, and the established corporate brand voice into every draft.
- **Generation**: Once all parameters and quotes are configured, the **Generate Article** function initiates the autonomous drafting process, producing a polished, ready-to-review professional document.
