## What you can do

The Press module features an integrated AI optimization tool designed for granular refinement of generated content. This functionality allows users to improve specific sections of an article—such as executive quotes, technical descriptions, or strategic summaries—without re-generating the entire document. This ensures precise control over professional tone and clarity.

## Steps

To optimize a specific segment of text within a draft, utilize the following steps:

- **Text Selection**: Highlight the specific paragraph or sentence that requires refinement directly within the article editor.
- **AI Analysis**: The **Improve Suggestions** interface will automatically trigger, providing an alternative version of the selected text optimized for impact and professional standards.
- **Review and Execution**:
  - **Replace**: Instantly swap the original text with the AI-optimized suggestion.
  - **Generate More**: Request additional variations if the initial suggestion does not align with the desired messaging.
  - **Cancel**: Dismiss the suggestion window to retain the original text.

## When to use this

This tool facilitates rapid editorial iterations, enabling users to:

- Enhance the narrative flow of complex medical or financial data.
- Adjust the professional tone of stakeholder-specific messaging.
- Correct stylistic inconsistencies within collaborative drafts.
- Ensure that key messaging pillars are articulated with maximum clarity and authority.

Tip: give the AI a short instruction (e.g., “make this more concise for investors” or “add regulatory context”) before generating more variations.
