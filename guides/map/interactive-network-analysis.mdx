## What you can do

- Isolate a KOL’s immediate network with one click.
- See connections grouped by relationship type.
- Jump to the full KOL profile for deeper insights.

## Steps

1. Open the [Network map](/guides/map).
2. Click a KOL node.
3. Review the side panel categories and use **View KOL Profile** if needed.

The system populates a specialized side panel that categorizes the selected expert’s connections into three distinct strategic layers:

- **Shared events**: KOLs who co-attended events (often shown with a count of shared events).
- **Same institution**: KOLs at the same organization.
- **Same specialty**: KOLs with the same clinical domain across institutions.

## Context and navigation

Alongside the network data, the side panel provides immediate visibility into the expert’s professional dossier:

- **Credential Summary**: Displays the expert's Tier, Engagement Level, Primary Institution, and specific expertise areas (e.g., Hemodynamic management, TEE).
- **Communication Access**: Provides verified contact information (e.g., professional email) for immediate outreach.
- **Full Profile Integration**: The **View KOL Profile** button allows for a seamless transition from the visual map to the expert’s comprehensive AI-driven intelligence profile for deep-dive analysis.

## Questions you can answer

- Which KOLs are most connected within an institution?
- Who are the close peers of a Tier 1 KOL in a specialty?
- Which event clusters could be used to expand outreach?

## Focus mode

Upon selection, the main map interface enters a "focused" state, dimming unrelated nodes and using directed orange paths to illustrate the direct reach of the selected KOL. This provides a clear, uncluttered view of the expert’s sphere of influence within the broader organizational ecosystem.
