**1. Overview**

Selecting a specific node within the Map module initiates an interactive discovery mode. This feature is designed to deconstruct the complex professional network of a single Key Opinion Leader (KOL), instantly isolating and highlighting their multi-dimensional connections. It serves as a powerful retrieval tool for identifying peer clusters, institutional strongholds, and specialty-aligned experts.

**2. Relational Categories in Detail**

The system populates a specialized side panel that categorizes the selected expert’s connections into three distinct strategic layers:

- **Shared Events**: Identifies other KOLs who have attended the same organizational activities as the selected expert. The system displays the specific number of shared instances (e.g., "Sarah Mitchell - 3 shared events"), allowing users to pinpoint established social and professional circles.
- **Same Institution**: Surfaces all other experts within the database who are affiliated with the same organization (e.g., Mayo Clinic). This allows for rapid identification of institutional influence and assists in account-based engagement strategies.
- **Same Specialty**: Lists peers who share the same clinical or academic focus (e.g., Anesthesiology). This enables users to discover clinical counterparts across various institutions, facilitating broader outreach within a specific therapeutic area.

**3. Expert Context and Navigation**

Alongside the network data, the side panel provides immediate visibility into the expert’s professional dossier:

- **Credential Summary**: Displays the expert's Tier, Engagement Level, Primary Institution, and specific expertise areas (e.g., Hemodynamic management, TEE).
- **Communication Access**: Provides verified contact information (e.g., professional email) for immediate outreach.
- **Full Profile Integration**: The **View KOL Profile** button allows for a seamless transition from the visual map to the expert’s comprehensive AI-driven intelligence profile for deep-dive analysis.

**4. Strategic Retrieval Value**

By visualizing these relationships in real-time, the platform eliminates the need for manual cross-referencing across disconnected spreadsheets. Users can instantly answer critical strategic questions:

- "Which experts within a specific hospital have the highest engagement with our events?"
- "Who are the most influential peers of our Tier 1 KOLs within a specific clinical specialty?"
- "How can we leverage existing institutional relationships to engage new experts?"

**5. Visual Focused Mode**

Upon selection, the main map interface enters a "focused" state, dimming unrelated nodes and using directed orange paths to illustrate the direct reach of the selected KOL. This provides a clear, uncluttered view of the expert’s sphere of influence within the broader organizational ecosystem.
