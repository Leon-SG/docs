**1. Overview**

The Map module provides a dynamic, visual representation of the organizational KOL ecosystem. By mapping the complex web of interactions between Key Opinion Leaders and events, this interface enables users to identify influential clusters, institutional bridges, and untapped collaborative potential. It transforms static database entries into a relational intelligence network for high-level strategic planning.

**2. Relational Intelligence and Mapping Logic**

The map visualizes connections based on three primary professional dimensions, represented by color-coded relationship lines:

- **Shared Events (Blue Lines)**: Connects KOLs who have participated in the same organizational events, indicating established peer-to-peer interaction within the system's ecosystem.
- **Same Institution (Green Lines)**: Identifies experts affiliated with the same medical center or academic organization, revealing geographic and institutional strongholds.
- **Same Specialty (Purple Lines)**: Links experts across different institutions who share identical clinical or research domains, highlighting specialty-specific networks.

**3. Strategic Segmentation and Node Analysis**

Each node on the map represents an individual KOL, with visual properties reflecting their strategic standing:

- **Engagement Level**: Nodes are color-coded by the degree of organizational interaction: **High (Green)**, **Medium (Orange)**, or **Low (Grey)**.
- **Tier Classification**: The size and shading of the nodes correspond to the assigned tier (Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3), allowing for the immediate identification of the most critical influencers in the network.
- **Network Statistics**: The top summary bar tracks the total volume of the network, currently monitoring **77 KOLs** and **268 unique connections**.

**4. Filtering and Layout Controls**

To navigate complex networks, the interface includes professional visualization tools:

- **Event Filtering**: Isolate relationships formed through specific events or time periods via the **All Events** dropdown.
- **Visualization Modes**: Toggle between different layout algorithms, such as **Force Directed**, to optimize the clarity of dense clusters or identify isolated experts on the periphery.
- **Advanced Filters**: Refine the view based on tier, engagement level, or specialty to focus on specific strategic subsets.

**5. Operational Utility**

The Relationship Map serves as a critical tool for identifying "Hub" KOLs—experts with a high number of cross-institutional and cross-event connections. This data is essential for optimizing speaker selection, identifying advocates for new product launches, and understanding the peer-influence landscape within specific therapeutic areas.
