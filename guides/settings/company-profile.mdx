## Why this matters

Company Profile is the primary source of truth the platform uses to ground AI outputs in your brand, markets, and regulatory reality. Better profile data usually leads to more accurate investigations, articles, and signal relevance.

## Where to find it

- Open `Settings` → `Company Profile`.

## How AI uses these fields

| Field | Used by | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Company description | Investigations, Press | Sets domain context and brand voice |
| Target markets | Signals, Investigations | Prioritizes jurisdictions and trends |
| Regulatory certifications | Signals, Press | Adds compliance context and constraints |
| Competitors | Investigations | Focuses monitoring and comparisons |
| Achievements | Press | Adds credible proof points and milestones |

## Recommended sections to fill

- **Basic Information**
  - **Company Identity**: Capture the official Company Name, Industry, and Size.
  - **Strategic Description**: Write 3–6 sentences that clearly explain what you build, for whom, and in which markets.
  - **Corporate Metadata**: Includes Website, Headquarters, and Founding Year to provide external-facing credibility in public profiles.
- **Target Markets**

  Define the geographic regions where your organization currently operates or intends to expand (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific). The AI utilizes these tags to prioritize regulatory signals and market trends specific to these jurisdictions.
- **Regulatory Certifications**

  Document the organization's compliance framework by adding specific certifications (e.g., FDA 510(k), CE Mark (MDR), ISO 13485). This data allows the system to monitor the impact of global regulatory shifts on your specific authorized capabilities.
- **Competitive Landscape and Achievements**
  - **Key Competitors**: Identifying rival organizations allows the AI agents to focus their monitoring efforts during strategic investigations.
  - **Key Achievements**: Documenting significant milestones provides the AI with "proof points" to include in press releases and professional summaries.

## Tip

Aim for high profile completeness and always click **Save Changes**. Missing markets/certifications often leads to irrelevant signals and generic AI copy.
