**1. Overview** The Registrations module is a dedicated regulatory compliance dashboard designed to manage the full lifecycle of medical device authorizations across multiple global jurisdictions. This centralized registry ensures that all market access credentials are systematically tracked, from initial submission through approval and periodic renewal, minimizing the risk of compliance lapses.

**2. Lifecycle Tracking and Status Monitoring** To facilitate effective oversight of the organizational regulatory footprint, the system categorizes registrations into distinct lifecycle stages:

- **Active**: Displays all currently valid registrations that permit active market distribution.
- **Pending**: Tracks ongoing applications and submissions currently under review by regulatory authorities.
- **Expiring**: Highlights registrations approaching their end-of-validity date, enabling regulatory teams to initiate renewal processes proactively to ensure uninterrupted market access.

**3. Comprehensive Registration Registry** The primary interface provides high-level visibility into the technical and legal parameters of each registration:

- **Product and Identifier**: Lists the specific device (e.g., VentMax Pro) along with its associated regulatory submission number (e.g., FDA 510(k) numbers like K231456).
- **Regulatory Authority**: Identifies the governing body responsible for the oversight (e.g., U.S. Food and Drug Administration).
- **Status and Type**: Provides real-time updates on the standing of the registration (e.g., "Approved") and the nature of the filing (e.g., "Initial Registration").
- **Expiration Management**: Displays the mandatory expiration dates, serving as the primary data point for compliance maintenance.

**4. Administrative Operations**

- **New Registration**: The "New Registration" button allows users to initialize a new regulatory filing record, capturing the specific product, target authority, and submission type.
- **Search and Filter**: A global search bar enables users to quickly retrieve specific filings by product name, authority, or registration ID.
- **Data Maintenance**: The "Updated" column ensures that stakeholders are aware of the last point of data verification for each entry.

**5. Strategic Integration** The Registrations module functions as a critical data layer that informs other system features. It provides the legal context for Product module data, influences Market Opportunity scanning in Investigations, and ensures that KOL engagement is aligned with the actual regulatory standing of the organization’s portfolio in specific regions.
