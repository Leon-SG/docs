## What you can do

- See a complete history of a registration (timeline + milestones).
- Track correspondence and required post-market commitments.
- Keep metadata up to date (type, class, jurisdiction).

## Activity timeline

The timeline provides an audit trail of key milestones (submission, requests, determinations, renewals).

## Registration metadata

- **Registration Type**: Defines the nature of the submission (e.g., Initial Registration).
- **Device Classification**: Specifies the regulatory class assigned to the product (e.g., Class II).
- **Country/Region**: Identifies the geographic jurisdiction governing the registration (e.g., United States).

## Commitments and correspondence

- **Correspondence Management**: Records all incoming and outgoing official communications, including **Deficiency Letters**, **Submission Letters**, and **Approval Letters**. Each entry identifies the status (e.g., Sent, Received) and the direction of the communication.
- **Regulatory Commitments**: Tracks mandatory post-market obligations such as **Annual Post-Market Clinical Study Reports**, **Software Update Validations**, and **Labeling Revisions**.
- **Compliance Alerts**: Dynamic status tags highlight urgent items (e.g., **Overdue** or **Response Required**) and prioritize tasks based on their impact level (High/Medium).

## Actions

- **Update Status**: Manually modify the high-level standing of the registration based on new developments.
- **Edit**: Update technical metadata or registration identifiers (e.g., FDA K-numbers).
- **Portal Access**: Direct linkage to the official regulatory body’s submission portal for external verification or data retrieval.
- **Add Commitment/Correspondence**: Manually append new records to the registry to ensure the dossier remains comprehensive and current.
