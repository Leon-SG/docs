### Strategic Investigations and AI Intelligence

![Image](/images/image-12.png)

**1. Overview**

The Investigations module serves as an advanced analytical engine designed to conduct deep-dive research into complex MedTech topics. By leveraging specialized autonomous AI agents, the system automates the gathering and synthesis of global regulatory, competitive, and market data into structured, executive-level strategic briefings.

**2. Autonomous AI Agents and Workflow**

Users can initiate specialized research by defining a topic or strategic objective.

- **Investigation Creation**: The "New Investigation" button allows users to deploy an AI agent to analyze specific areas of interest.
- **Status Tracking**: The system provides real-time visibility into the research lifecycle, with status indicators such as "Generating..." (active research in progress), "Draft" (pending review), and "Completed" (final report ready for analysis).
- **Historical Archive**: The left-hand panel maintains a centralized library of all past investigations, categorized by date and completion status for rapid retrieval.

**3. Comprehensive Strategic Briefing Structure**

The AI agents generate multi-dimensional reports that address critical business domains:

- **Regulatory & Policy Changes**: Regional analysis of shifts in major markets (e.g., FDA, EU MDR, NMPA, PMDA). The report synthesizes how these changes impact organizational cost structures, compliance deadlines, and market entry pathways.
- **Competitor Intelligence**: Continuous monitoring of competitor activities, including new product launches, AI integrations, strategic partnerships, and legal developments (e.g., monitoring updates from GE Healthcare, Philips, and Nihon Kohden).
- **Business Opportunity Identification**: Detection of emerging prospects within international aid projects and infrastructure developments, such as new health initiatives funded by the World Bank or other international organizations.

**4. Documentation and Distribution Utilities**

To support executive decision-making and cross-functional collaboration, the module includes professional document management tools:

- **Multi-Format Export**: Generate high-fidelity reports in PDF or editable Word formats for formal presentations or internal documentation.
- **Collaborative Sharing**: The "Share Report" function enables the direct distribution of findings to stakeholders across the organization.
- **Management Tools**: Administrators can delete outdated reports or refresh existing investigations to include the most recent data signals.
