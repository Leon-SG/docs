### Creating a New Investigation

**1. Overview**

The investigation creation process is a guided, three-step workflow designed to define the specific methodology and depth of the AI-driven research. By selecting a specialized template, users can ensure the AI agent utilizes the correct analytical framework to meet their strategic objectives.

**2. Research Templates**

The system provides four distinct research frameworks, each optimized for specific business intelligence requirements:

- **Competitor Deep Dive**

  This is a comprehensive, four-pillar framework that synthesizes regulatory updates, competitor activities, market opportunities, and general industry sentiment. It is recommended for executive-level strategic briefings and high-level market assessment.
- **Regulatory Watch**

  Focused specifically on compliance and legal shifts, this template monitors regional regulatory changes and evolving compliance requirements. It is designed for regulatory affairs teams needing to track market access parameters in specific jurisdictions.
- **Market Opportunity Scanner**

  This methodology prioritizes the identification of commercial prospects. It scans global databases for tenders, grants, and business opportunities issued by international organizations and infrastructure funds.
- **Sentiment Analysis**

  Concentrates on brand perception and market reputation. This template analyzes data across social media, professional networks, and industry publications to gauge public and professional opinion regarding specific brands or medical technologies.

**3. Configuration Workflow**

The investigation setup is divided into three sequential phases:

1. **Basics**: Define the title and the core subject of the investigation.
2. **Template**: Select the research framework that aligns with the intended analytical output.
3. **Scope**: Establish the geographic boundaries (e.g., specific countries or regions) and the time parameters for the data collection.

**4. Finalization**

After selecting the appropriate template, users can navigate between steps using the **Back** and **Continue** buttons. Once the scope is defined in the final step, the AI agent will initiate the autonomous research process.
