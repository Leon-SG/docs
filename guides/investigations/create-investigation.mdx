## What you can do

- Start a new investigation report using a template.
- Control depth and focus by picking the right framework.
- Define scope (regions and time range) to keep results relevant.

## Steps

1. Open `Investigations` and click **New Investigation**.
2. Complete the setup flow:
   - **Basics**: set a clear title and topic.
   - **Template**: choose the research framework.
   - **Scope**: pick regions/countries and time parameters.
3. Click **Continue** to start generation.

## Templates and when to use them

- **Competitor deep dive**: broad, executive-style brief across competitors, regulations, opportunities, and signals.
- **Regulatory watch**: focused monitoring of compliance and policy shifts.
- **Market opportunity scanner**: looks for tenders, grants, and commercial opportunities.
- **Sentiment analysis**: analyzes perception across publications and social/professional channels.

## Tips

- Use specific topics (company/product/region) instead of broad themes for more actionable output.
- Start with a narrower scope, then expand if you need more coverage.
