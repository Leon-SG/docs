## What you can do

- Generate a unique public URL for an event.
- Share the URL with attendees.
- Disable the link to revoke access instantly.
- Control visibility, capacity, and approval rules for registration.

## Where to find it

- Open `Events` → select an event → `Activity Overview` → `Public Sharing`.

## Manage the public link

- **Copy link**: click **Copy** to share the URL (e.g., `https://app.medstrato.com/...`).
- **Deactivate link**: disables the URL immediately and blocks new access.

## What attendees can do on the public page

- **Event Information**: View the essential details configured in the **Basic Information**, **Date & Time**, and **Location** sections, including the event description, schedule, and venue map.
- **Registration**: Attendees can sign up for the event directly. The registration flow adheres to the rules set in the **Registration Settings** (e.g., "Invite Only" or "Approval Required").
- **Submissions**: The portal provides a secure interface for attendees to submit required materials, such as speaker abstracts, presentation decks, or post-event feedback.

## Visibility and access control

The behavior of the Public Page is governed by the **Registration** settings panel:

- **Event Visibility**: Controls whether the page is accessible to the general public or restricted to organization members.
- **Capacity Management**: If a **Maximum Attendees** limit is set, the Public Page will automatically close registration once the cap is reached or redirect users to a waitlist.
- **Approval Logic**: If "Require manual approval for all registrations" is enabled, registrants via the Public Page will be placed in a "Pending" state until verified by an administrator.

## Warning

Deactivating the link will immediately invalidate the URL. If you need to re-enable access, generate and share a new link.
