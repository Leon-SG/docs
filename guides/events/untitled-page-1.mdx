**1. Overview**

The Public Page serves as the external-facing landing page for your event. It is an automatically generated portal designed to centralize all critical event information for attendees. This page acts as the primary interface for public interaction, facilitating information dissemination, attendee registration, and content submission without requiring access to the internal system.

**2. Access and Management**

The Public Page URL is managed within the **Activity Overview** tab under the **Public Sharing** section (located on the bottom right of the interface).

- **Link Generation**: The system generates a unique, secure URL for every event (e.g., https://app.getstrato.dev/...).
- **Sharing**: Click the **Copy** button to retrieve the link for distribution via email, social media, or marketing campaigns.
- **Deactivation**: To immediately revoke public access to the event page, use the **Deactivate Link** button. This renders the URL invalid, preventing further registrations or views.

**3. Public Page Functionalities**

When visitors access the Public Page, they can perform the following actions based on your configuration:

- **Event Information**: View the essential details configured in the **Basic Information**, **Date & Time**, and **Location** sections, including the event description, schedule, and venue map.
- **Registration**: Attendees can sign up for the event directly. The registration flow adheres to the rules set in the **Registration Settings** (e.g., "Invite Only" or "Approval Required").
- **Submissions**: The portal provides a secure interface for attendees to submit required materials, such as speaker abstracts, presentation decks, or post-event feedback.

**4. Visibility and Access Control**

The behavior of the Public Page is governed by the **Registration** settings panel:

- **Event Visibility**: Controls whether the page is accessible to the general public or restricted to organization members.
- **Capacity Management**: If a **Maximum Attendees** limit is set, the Public Page will automatically close registration once the cap is reached or redirect users to a waitlist.
- **Approval Logic**: If "Require manual approval for all registrations" is enabled, registrants via the Public Page will be placed in a "Pending" state until verified by an administrator.
