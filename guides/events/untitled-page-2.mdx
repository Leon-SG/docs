**1. Portal Overview**

The Public Page serves as the external-facing destination for event attendees. Designed for accessibility and clarity, this interface consolidates all critical event logistics, scheduling, and engagement tools into a single, shareable view. It ensures that participants have immediate access to the latest event updates without needing to log in to the backend system.

**2. Event Essentials and Utilities**

The header section provides immediate visibility into the core logistical parameters of the event:

- **Key Details**: Clearly displays the Event Title, Date range, Time duration, and physical Location (e.g., Singapore).
- **Calendar Synchronization**: The **Add to Calendar** button allows attendees to instantly export the event schedule to their personal calendars (Google, Outlook, iCal), ensuring better attendance rates.
- **Social Sharing**: The **Share** button generates direct links for distribution across social platforms or communication channels to increase event reach.

**3. Program and Agenda Visibility**

The body of the page dynamically renders the content configured in the administrative backend:

- **Contextual Information**: The "About This Event" and "Objectives" sections provide attendees with the background context, goals, and target audience for the gathering.
- **Live Agenda**: The "Agenda" section presents a chronological breakdown of the event schedule. It details specific session times, topics, and venue instructions (e.g., "Registration & Morning Tea at Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre"), helping attendees plan their participation effectively.

**4. Interactive Capabilities**

Beyond information consumption, the portal acts as the primary gateway for attendee action:

- **Registration**: (If enabled) Users can initiate the registration process directly from this interface, subject to the capacity and approval rules defined in the event settings.
- **Material Submission**: For academic or collaborative events, the portal provides secure entry points for attendees to upload required documents, such as speaker abstracts, posters, or pre-event surveys.

**5. Overview**

The registration module on the Public Page is designed to provide a low-friction entry point for prospective participants. By streamlining the data collection process to essential fields, the system ensures a high conversion rate for event sign-ups while maintaining data integrity within the organizational database.

**6. Registration Requirements**

To complete the registration, participants are required to provide the following mandatory information:

- **Full Name**: The legal or professional name of the attendee as it should appear on the event registry and badges.
- **Email**: A valid professional email address used for sending confirmation details, digital tickets, and event updates.

**7. Submission and Validation**

- **Submit Registration**: Upon clicking the submission button, the system performs an instantaneous validation check to ensure all required fields are correctly formatted.
- **Data Synchronization**: Once submitted, the attendee's information is automatically synchronized with the internal **Attendees** management tab in the administrative dashboard.

**8. Post-Registration Workflow**

The outcome of the registration is governed by the pre-configured event settings:

- **Automatic Confirmation**: If the event is set to open registration, the participant will receive an immediate confirmation email.
- **Pending Approval**: If manual approval is required, the participant will be notified that their request is under review. The status will remain "Pending" in the system until an administrator manually confirms or declines the entry.
- **Capacity Control**: The system monitors registration in real-time against the maximum attendee limit. Once the capacity is reached, the registration form will automatically transition to a "Closed" or "Waitlist" state.
