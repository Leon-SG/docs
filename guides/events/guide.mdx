**1. Dashboard Overview**

The Events Dashboard provides a comprehensive registry of all organizational engagements. It allows users to track upcoming conferences, symposiums, and meetings, while offering high-level visibility into attendance status and invitation performance.

**2. Search and Filtering**

To manage event timelines effectively, the top navigation bar offers sorting and retrieval tools:

- **Search**: Locate specific events by title or keyword.
- **Time-Based Filters**: Categorize events by their schedule (e.g., \< 1 Month, \< 2 Months, \> 3 Months) or view historical data via the "Completed" tab.

**3. Event Metrics & Monitoring**

The main list view displays key data points for each event to facilitate quick assessment:

- **Core Details**: Displays the Event Title, Type (e.g., Conference, Symposium), Date, and Location.
- **Attendance Status**: Provides a real-time breakdown of attendee responses, categorizing them into Confirmed, Tentative, Declined, or Pending.
- **Invitation Analytics**: Tracks the lifecycle of sent invitations, offering metrics on delivery, open rates, and responses.

**4. Event Management**

- **Create New**: The "New Event" button allows for the initialization and configuration of a new event entry.
- **View Details**: Selecting an event row from the list opens the detailed management view, allowing for in-depth control over attendee lists and event-specific settings.

### Event Details & Management

**1. Interface Overview**

Upon selecting a specific event from the main dashboard, the system opens the Event Details view. This interface is structured around six dedicated functional tabs, allowing for granular management of every aspect of the event lifecycle.

**2. Functional Modules**

- **Team**

  Facilitates internal collaboration. This tab is used to assign team members to the event, define roles, and distribute tasks among the organizing committee to ensure clear ownership of responsibilities.
- **Agenda**

  Provides a chronological timeline of the event program.
  - **Schedule Management**: Users can view and configure individual sessions, breaks, and activities.
  - **Session Details**: Each entry displays the time, duration, session title, descriptive context, and specific venue location (e.g., "Begonia Ballroom").
  - **Categorization**: Activities are tagged by type (e.g., "REGISTRATION", "SESSION") for easy visual distinction.
- **Attendees**

  Centralizes the database of participants for this specific event. This module allows users to manage guest profiles, view individual status, and handle access control or VIP segmentation.
- **Invitations**

  Manages the outreach strategy. Users can track the status of sent invitations, monitor open and click-through rates, and trigger follow-up communications to unconfirmed guests.
- **Materials**

  Acts as a digital repository for event assets. This section is used to store and organize collateral such as presentation decks, brochures, and logistical documents required for the event.
- **Submissions**

  Handles incoming data from external sources. This is primarily used for collecting and reviewing items such as speaker abstracts, poster session entries, or post-event feedback forms.
