## What attendees can do

- View logistics (date, time, location), agenda, and event context.
- Add the event to a calendar and share the page.
- Register (if enabled) and submit materials (if enabled).

## Public page features

The header section provides immediate visibility into the core logistical parameters of the event:

- **Key Details**: Clearly displays the Event Title, Date range, Time duration, and physical Location (e.g., Singapore).
- **Calendar Synchronization**: The **Add to Calendar** button allows attendees to instantly export the event schedule to their personal calendars (Google, Outlook, iCal), ensuring better attendance rates.
- **Social Sharing**: The **Share** button generates direct links for distribution across social platforms or communication channels to increase event reach.

## Agenda and content

The body of the page dynamically renders the content configured in the administrative backend:

- **Contextual Information**: The "About This Event" and "Objectives" sections provide attendees with the background context, goals, and target audience for the gathering.
- **Live Agenda**: The "Agenda" section presents a chronological breakdown of the event schedule. It details specific session times, topics, and venue instructions (e.g., "Registration & Morning Tea at Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre"), helping attendees plan their participation effectively.

## Registration flow

If registration is enabled, attendees complete a short form and submit.

### Required fields

- **Full name**
- **Email**

### What happens after submission

- **Auto-confirm**: attendees receive a confirmation email immediately (open registration).
- **Approval required**: attendees remain **Pending** until an admin approves.
- **Capacity rules**: when the maximum is reached, registration closes or moves to a waitlist.

## Admin notes

- Registrations sync into the internal event **Attendees** list for tracking and follow-up.
