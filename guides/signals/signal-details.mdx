## What you can do

- Understand what changed and who issued it.
- See which products might be impacted and why.
- Save/share the signal and open the original source.

## Signal metadata

Each detail view consolidates essential intelligence parameters:

- **Source and Authority**: Identifies the issuing body (e.g., World Health Organization) and the jurisdiction (e.g., Switzerland).
- **Impact and Sentiment Assessment**: Provides a categorized impact rating (e.g., Medium Impact) and a sentiment analysis (e.g., Positive) to help users prioritize the urgency of the update.
- **Chronological Tracking**: Displays the precise publication date and time to ensure the intelligence is current.

## Related products

The "Related Products" section is the core analytical component of the details panel. It maps the regulatory signal to relevant medical devices within your inventory:

- **Automated Impact Logic**: The system identifies products potentially affected by the regulatory change (e.g., AnesThesia X9, SleepWell Monitor).
- **Contextual Rationale**: For every correlated product, the system provides a specific justification for the "Potential Impact." For example, it may highlight how a new pandemic agreement could increase demand for specific workstations or how pathogen-sharing requirements might affect in-vitro diagnostic development.
- **Direct Product Navigation**: Each product entry includes a hyperlink to the internal product master data, allowing for immediate cross-referencing of technical specifications and existing registrations.

## Actions

To facilitate rapid decision-making and data portability, the interface includes the following tools:

- **Ask AI**: Initiates a natural language interaction with the AI assistant to summarize the signal, translate complex regulatory text, or extract specific action items.
- **Save and Archive**: Allows users to bookmark critical signals for future reference or inclusion in periodic regulatory reports.
- **View Original**: Provides a direct link to the official source document or the primary regulatory announcement to ensure data transparency and facilitate further legal or technical review.

## Tip

Use **Ask AI** to extract a short action list (who should review, what products to check, and what deadlines might apply), then validate against the source link.
