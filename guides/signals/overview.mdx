**1. Overview**

The Signals module is a real-time regulatory intelligence engine. It monitors and aggregates critical updates, policy changes, and market announcements from the world’s leading healthcare and medical device regulatory authorities. This tool enables organizations to proactively manage compliance risks and identify strategic opportunities by staying ahead of the global regulatory landscape.

**2. Monitored Regulatory Sources**

The system tracks high-authority data streams from primary global regulators and industry intelligence providers, including:

- **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**
- **European Medicines Agency (EMA)**
- **World Health Organization (WHO)**
- **Health Canada**
- **Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)**
- **Regulatory Focus (RAPS)**
- **MedTech Dive**

**3. Impact Assessment and Visualization**

Every signal is processed and categorized based on its potential influence on the industry or specific product lines.

- **Geospatial Intelligence**: The heat map visualizes the geographic concentration of regulatory activity. Clusters are color-coded to represent the highest level of urgency in a specific region.
- **Impact Levels**:
  - **Critical (Red)**: Major regulatory shifts or safety alerts requiring immediate attention.
  - **High (Orange)**: Significant policy changes or new approval requirements.
  - **Medium (Yellow)**: Standard updates, pilot program news, or administrative changes.
  - **Low (Blue)**: Routine reports or general industry information.

**4. Signal Registry and Data Mapping**

The signal table provides a structured view of each intelligence item:

- **Source and Origin**: Identifies the specific regulator and the country of origin.
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Provides the title and a concise summary of the regulatory update.
- **Product Alignment**: A key feature that automatically links regulatory signals to specific medical devices in your portfolio (e.g., "AnesThesia X9"), allowing users to immediately see which products are affected by a specific update.
- **Sentiment and Timing**: Captures the tone of the update and the official publication date to ensure historical tracking.

**5. Advanced Filtering and Retrieval**

To navigate the high volume of global signals, users can refine the feed using several parameters:

- **Source Filter**: Isolate updates from specific authorities like the FDA or EMA.
- **Impact and Sentiment Filters**: Focus on critical risks or positive market developments.
- **Product Filter**: View only the regulatory changes that directly impact selected product lines.
- **Keyword Search**: Search for specific technical terms, device categories, or legislative acts.
