- **Funder and Recipient**: Lists the specific organizations and sovereign nations involved in the transaction.
- **Project Name and Scope**: Provides the official title and sector classification (e.g., "Health System Efficiency and Resilience Project"), giving users insight into the specific types of medical equipment and services required.
- **Amount**: Displays the precise financial scale of the project (e.g., USD 50.0M).
- **Timeframe**: Indicates the fiscal period or quarter (e.g., 2026-Q1) in which the funding or project is scheduled.
