## What you can do

- Open a country to see summary metrics and its project list.
- Open a project to see funder/recipient details, status, and financials.
- Export/share details for internal planning and reporting.

## Recipient country insights

Selecting a recipient node or country from the list opens a summary panel providing a high-level overview of that market’s procurement profile:

- **Aggregate Metrics**: Displays the total number of projects received and the cumulative financial value (e.g., USD 1.2B total) for the selected region.
- **Project Portfolio**: Lists all individual initiatives currently active or historical within that country. Each entry includes the project title, current status (e.g., Active), total funding amount, and the originating funder.
- **Navigation**: Users can click on any project in this list to drill down further into specific funding flow details.

## Funding flow details

The most granular level of data is found in the **Funding Flow Details** panel, which provides technical and financial specifics for a single project:

- **Funder and Recipient Specifications**: Identifies the primary funding organization (e.g., World Bank) and the specific sovereign entity or sub-organization receiving the support.
- **Project Metadata**: Displays the official Project Name, Sector Type (e.g., Health), current Status, and a unique **Project ID** for cross-referencing with official institutional databases.
- **Financial Breakdown**: Provides the precise funding amount, the currency utilized, and the specific time period or fiscal quarter (e.g., 2026-Q1) associated with the disbursement.

## Export and sharing

To facilitate internal reporting and collaborative analysis, the detail panels include the following utilities:

- **Export**: Enables the download of specific project data for integration into external spreadsheets or CRM systems.
- **Share**: Generates a direct link to the specific funding flow or country overview, allowing for rapid communication of market insights among team members.
- **External Reference**: Where available, users can utilize the Project ID to link directly to external funder documentation for additional technical specifications.

## Tip

When comparing markets, prioritize consistent timeframes and currency context to avoid misleading “top country” conclusions.
