**1. Overview**

The Trends module allows users to transition from high-level global visualizations to granular project data. By interacting with the map or the data registry, users can access comprehensive dossiers on specific geographic markets and individual funding flows to support data-driven market entry strategies.

**2. Recipient Country Insights**

Selecting a recipient node or country from the list opens a summary panel providing a high-level overview of that market’s procurement profile:

- **Aggregate Metrics**: Displays the total number of projects received and the cumulative financial value (e.g., USD 1.2B total) for the selected region.
- **Project Portfolio**: Lists all individual initiatives currently active or historical within that country. Each entry includes the project title, current status (e.g., Active), total funding amount, and the originating funder.
- **Navigation**: Users can click on any project in this list to drill down further into specific funding flow details.

**3. Funding Flow Details**

The most granular level of data is found in the **Funding Flow Details** panel, which provides technical and financial specifics for a single project:

- **Funder and Recipient Specifications**: Identifies the primary funding organization (e.g., World Bank) and the specific sovereign entity or sub-organization receiving the support.
- **Project Metadata**: Displays the official Project Name, Sector Type (e.g., Health), current Status, and a unique **Project ID** for cross-referencing with official institutional databases.
- **Financial Breakdown**: Provides the precise funding amount, the currency utilized, and the specific time period or fiscal quarter (e.g., 2026-Q1) associated with the disbursement.

**4. Data Portability and Sharing**

To facilitate internal reporting and collaborative analysis, the detail panels include the following utilities:

- **Export**: Enables the download of specific project data for integration into external spreadsheets or CRM systems.
- **Share**: Generates a direct link to the specific funding flow or country overview, allowing for rapid communication of market insights among team members.
- **External Reference**: Where available, users can utilize the Project ID to link directly to external funder documentation for additional technical specifications.
