**1. Overview**

The Trends module provides real-time geospatial intelligence on global healthcare procurement and funding flows. By aggregating data from major international organizations (e.g., World Bank), the system visualizes the distribution of medical equipment tenders, health system strengthening projects, and significant financial commitments across the globe.

**2. Geospatial Flow Analysis**

The interactive map provides a visual representation of how healthcare capital moves globally:

- **Funders (Red Nodes)**: Identifies the primary source organizations initiating the funding or procurement requests.
- **Recipients (Green Nodes)**: Identifies the specific countries or regions receiving the equipment or funding.
- **Flow Lines**: Illustrates the direct connection between funding sources and destination projects, allowing users to identify emerging market clusters and international procurement corridors.

**3. Market Analytics and Ranking**

The **Top Recipients** sidebar provides a high-level summary of market activity, ranking countries by:

- **Volume**: The total number of active procurement flows or projects.
- **Financial Value**: The total monetary scale of the medical equipment and health initiatives assigned to that region.

**4. Detailed Procurement Registry**

The data table beneath the map provides granular transparency into every individual flow:

- **Funder and Recipient**: Lists the specific organizations and sovereign nations involved in the transaction.
- **Project Name and Scope**: Provides the official title and sector classification (e.g., "Health System Efficiency and Resilience Project"), giving users insight into the specific types of medical equipment and services required.
- **Amount**: Displays the precise financial scale of the project (e.g., USD 50.0M).
- **Timeframe**: Indicates the fiscal period or quarter (e.g., 2026-Q1) in which the funding or project is scheduled.

**5. Strategic Search and Filtering**

To facilitate targeted market research, users can refine the global dataset using the following parameters:

- **Search Bar**: Locate specific projects or keywords within the procurement descriptions.
- **Time Filter**: Analyze historical trends or upcoming quarterly forecasts.
- **Funder/Location Filters**: Isolate data from specific organizations or geographic regions.
- **Project Filter**: Categorize results by specific medical niches or project types.
