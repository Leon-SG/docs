**1. Overview**

The Inbox serves as the central hub for task management within the system. All tasks assigned to you by your team are aggregated here to streamline workflow and ensure centralized visibility of your responsibilities.

**2. Viewing and Managing Tasks**

- **Task List**: Upon accessing the Inbox interface, you will see a comprehensive list of all tasks currently assigned to you.
- **Task Details**: Select a specific task entry within the list to display the detailed view. This allows you to review the specific requirements, descriptions, and objectives associated with the assignment.

**3. Notification Mechanisms**

To ensure timely awareness of new assignments, the system currently utilizes a dual-notification system:

- **In-App Notifications**: New task assignments are instantly reflected within the Inbox module.
- **Email Alerts**: An automated notification is sent to the user's registered email address whenever a new task is assigned.

_Note: Integration with third-party communication platforms, such as WhatsApp and Slack, will be supported in future updates._
